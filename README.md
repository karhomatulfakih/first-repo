# Tic Tac Toe — Python (Mini Project)

## Overview
This repository contains a simple Tic Tac Toe game built in Python.
The project was created as an early learning exercise to understand
basic programming concepts such as control flow, functions, and state handling.

## Purpose
The main goals of this project were:
- Practice Python syntax and logic
- Understand conditional statements and loops
- Learn how to structure a small program
- Get familiar with using Git and GitHub for version control

## Features
- Two-player game (played via terminal)
- Turn-based input handling
- Win and draw condition checks
- Simple and readable program flow

## Tech Stack
- Python (standard library only)

## Project Status
This is an **early learning / mini project**.
It is intentionally kept simple and is not intended to represent advanced
software engineering or data engineering practices.

## Notes
This repository serves as a baseline to track my learning progression.
More advanced and data-focused projects are developed in separate repositories.
